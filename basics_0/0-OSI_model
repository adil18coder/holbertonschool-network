## OSI Model

**Definition:**  
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an **abstract model** used to describe **network communication and design**. Its main purpose is to **separate communication functions into layers** for easier understanding.  

- The OSI model does **not perform actual network operations**. It is a **conceptual framework** to better understand complex interactions.  

## Organization

The OSI model consists of 7 layers, **from lowest to highest**:  

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** – Physical transmission: electrical impulses, light signals, or radio waves  
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** – Reliable node-to-node transmission and error detection  
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)** – Routing packets across networks (IP, ICMP)  
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** – End-to-end reliable or fast delivery (TCP, UDP)  
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)** – Establishing and managing sessions  
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)** – Formatting, encryption, and compression of data  
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)** – Application-specific communication (HTTP, SNMP, SMTP, etc.)  

## Project Focus

In this project, the main focus is:  
- **Transport Layer:** TCP/UDP  
- **Network Layer:** IP and ICMP  

## Questions

1. **What is the OSI model?**  
**Answer:** The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system **without regard to its internal structure and technology**.  

2. **How is the OSI model organized?**  
**Answer:** From the lowest to the highest layer.
